# Prototyping with Unity!
Experiment with the audio in Unity
About Learning Unity for my final project for this semester, need to learn the two pathways of Unity. Unity Essentials and Jr programmer. Let's get started!

I just thought that is better to just add all my prototypes in here than just add a lot of different repositories of Unity.

With the prototype 5 almost complete, next goal, complete the challenge 5 and lab 5(but in a few days).
